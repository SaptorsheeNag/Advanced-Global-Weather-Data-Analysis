PM Accelerator AI Engineer Technical Assessment for Data Scientist/Analyst
My name is Saptorshee Nag, applicant for the AI Engineer Intern - AI/ML/Gen AI Development Position. In this Google Colab notebook I have performed the advanced tech assessment on the Global Weather Repository dataset. I have written the code and added comments explaining each line of code. I have also explained the data cleaning, EDA, forecasting models, advanced analyses, and insights in a well-organized format.

You can open the "PM Accelerator AI Engineer Intern - AI/ML/Gen AI Development Tech Assessment For Data Scientists/Analyst.ipynb" file in Google Colab notebook to see the presentation of the detailed data analysis process I have performed on the Global Weather Repository Dataset.
